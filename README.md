# MixUp applied on CIFAR-10 dataset

**Inspired by** the article on Towards Data Science: "Enhancing Neural Networks with Mixup in PyTorch" of Ta-Ying Cheng and his github

**Mixup** is a data augmentation technique that that generates a weighted combinations of random image pairs from the training data.

While the number of data we have is limited, we can always try to slightly alter the images and use them as ‘new’ samples to feed into the network for training. This process is called data augmentation.
